## Changed
* Seeding slurry is now appreciably boosted in growing power
    * Will only work in atmospheres with at least trace amounts of CO2
    * As an upside, will now convert CO2 into O2 at a rate of 100mB of O2 per block of grass

## Fixed
* Capsules can be exited during transfers, when the doors should be locked
* Holding crouch can inconsistently drop you out of a capsule even when the doors are locked
    * Due to some vanilla shenanigans, you'll sometimes encounter visual issues if you hold the key, but now you'll still remain in the capsule
    * To prevent potential gamebreaking issues, you can force-leave a capsule by holding crouch for three seconds (unless in deep space, where you'll always be fully blocked from leaving)
* Fixed the old fusion station thruster appearing as the new. as-of-yet unimplemented one
